PROJECT SUMMARY
Website to Redesign:
Ascent Physiotherapy
https://ascentphysiotherapy.com/facilities.html
Why the Redesign:
The current website lacks visual appeal, relying heavily on text with minimal graphics. The design feels
outdated and may not effectively engage the audience, potentially hindering user experience and
retention.
Most Important Purpose:
The primary goal is to enhance the user experience, making information easily accessible and engaging.
This involves redesigning the Home, Contact Us, and Products & Services pages.
Current Site Issues:
The existing site is text-heavy, lacking visual elements that could enhance user engagement. The design
does not reflect modern web aesthetics, potentially leading to a less appealing user experience.
Overall Message:
The website aims to convey a sense of professionalism, expertise, and modernity. It should assure
visitors of Ascent Physiotherapy's competence and commitment to their well-being.
Target Audience:
The target audience includes individuals seeking physiotherapy services, potential clients looking for
information about the team and services, and those interested in rates and facilities.
Call-to-Action Priorities:
The main call-to-action is to encourage users to contact Ascent Physiotherapy for appointments or
inquiries. Additionally, directing users to explore services and facilities.
Look and Feel:
Mood: Professional, Modern, Trustworthy
Inspiration: Physiotherapy Plus, Rebalance Physiotherapy
Colors:
Primary: Blue (reflecting professionalism and trust)
Neutral: White/Grey (clean and modern)
Highlight: Green (associated with health and vitality)
Images:
